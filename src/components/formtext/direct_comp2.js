In order to create a fair process and avoid biasing the hiring manager, you need to name someone that the candidate can submit additional information to if they believe the benchmark or experience assessment are incorrect.  This could be someone in HR, another hiring manager, or the hiring manager’s manager (sometimes called a “skip level”).
What is the first and last name of the person to whom the candidate can submit additional information? <text validation>
What is their email? (email validation)
